## Advent of Code 2021
Kotlin and Excel lol.

Day 1 and 2 were super quick in Excel. I did not even bother to save them.

Day 3 and 4 were not too bad.

Day 5 was horrible to do in Excel. 
The files grew too large and is not included here, even if part one was done with it.
It was done a bit late, but not never.

Day 6 and 7 was done in Excel and not too bad.

On the eight day, he was very disappointed with Excel's ability to work with arrays 
and do string lookups and replacements. Part one was easy, but part two was not.
Here, I set up a basic kotlin project and completed it with the more capable Kotlin.

On the ninth day, the Excel hope lived again, but died shortly after starting part 2...
It was a helpful tool in thinking about the solution however.
