## Advent of Code 2021
Kotlin and Excel lol.

Day 1 and 2 were super quick in Excel. I did not even bother to save them.

Day 3 and 4 were not too bad.

Day 5 was horrible to do in Excel. 
The files grew too large and is not included here, even if part one was done with it.
It was done a bit late, but not never.

Day 6 and 7 was done in Excel and not too bad.

On the eight day, he was very disappointed with Excel's ability to work with arrays 
and do string lookups and replacements. Part one was easy, but part two was not.
Here, I set up a basic kotlin project and completed it with the more capable Kotlin.

On the ninth day, the Excel hope lived again, but died shortly after starting part 2...
It was a helpful tool in thinking about the solution, however.

Day 10 was completed without much ado. Here it was interesting to compare my solution with my friend,
as we had quite different approaches to the problem.

On day 14, I had not yet done day 11-13 to completion, but was enticed to start by my friend.
I noticed quickly it was similar to the reproducing fish from day 6, and solved part 2 in a similar way, 
although not in Excel, after doing part 1 the naive way.

Day 15 was a fun one, ending up not flattening my recursion but instead going to ever deeper depths by using Kotlin's
DeepRecursionFunction.

Day 16 was much fun, lots of lovely recursion and nesting. Had some issues with finding the padding zeroes but nothing
a try finally with prints can't get around.
